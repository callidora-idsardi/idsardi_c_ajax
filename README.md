## AJAX APP 

- Connected to an API, outputting information about Novo Earbuds as JSON.
- Used the Fetch API to retrieve the data on page load and update the view as the user interacts with the hotspots.
- Created an HTML Template element to display hotspot information and materials.
- Implemented a loading spinner & a user-facing error message.
